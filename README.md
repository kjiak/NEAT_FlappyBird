# NEAT_FlappyBird
Implementation of the NEAT algorithm for learning an agent to play Flappy Bird.

The game was designed using the pygame library while NEAT was implemented using the Python-NEAT package.

The NEAT algorithm is implemented using the NEAT-Python package. Ensure that the package is installed before running 
any of the codes.
